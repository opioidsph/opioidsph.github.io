In this article published in 2015 two scientists based in the Netherlands, Jan van Amsterdam and Wir van den Brink, compared the development of opioids (PO) prescription and abuse in the U.S., Canada and Europe and described factors that may have led to the differences between North America and Europe. Even if the medical use of POs has strongly increased in North America over the last two decades, a change in the opposite direction is going to lead to a prevalence of a non-medical use of POs. Similar to the U.S. and Canada, the consumption of POs recently increased considerably in Europe. However, unlike in North America, this increase in consumption has not resulted in an alarming increase in PO morbidity and mortality in Europe, except for the UK. This article explores the comparison and explains these differences by cultural factors and health system specificities. A lot of different measures, described in the article, are taken in both continents to reduce consumption and the adverse effects of opioids.
