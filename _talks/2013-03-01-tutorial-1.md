Severe chronic pain can be treated through opioids prescription, which are also linked to significant health risks. Nonetheless, such treatment is controversial, and raises several questions. This article, written in 2017 by Lynn R, is an overview of the wide-ranging use, targeted population, and risks related to opioid consumption. She also describes the available tools for clinicians and gives general advice for opioid use and prescription. The aim is to follow the existing prevention strategies to improve future therapeutic results related to pain handling. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental disorders, Opioid-use disorder (OUD) is a real health issue, clearly characterized, but in the need of visibility and awareness to be well managed. Overdose mortality, from any opioid, is considered to be possible even in small amounts, and particularly when combined with other drugs. This risk is one of all treated in the article, including suicide and diversion as major health risks.
