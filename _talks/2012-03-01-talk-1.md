The authors (J. Fiore & al.) of this scoping review article from 2019 searched 8 bibliographic databases, extracting study characteristics and results from studies addressing opioid-free analgesia methods. The goal is to provide an overview of ways forward for opioid-free analgesia as the prescription of such drugs is reportedly playing a key role in a current opioid addiction and overdose crisis. While 424 studies were identified in the database, the aim was mostly focused on the use of such substances during hospital stay and post-discharged alternatives were largely neglected. The main conclusion given by the article is that further research should be conducted to extend existing findings on the efficiency of opioid-free analgesia to a larger domain than general and obstetric surgery, especially in Northern America where efforts to mitigate opioid use in pain management are deemed insufficient.
