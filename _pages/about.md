This website is a creation, in response to the call for proposal launched by the European Union, to organize a vast public health campaign in all countries of the European Union. On behalf of the Opioid Public Health Association, a European public health association supporting patients and professionals for a more responsible use of prescription opioids, this proposition has been raised. 

We are three french students from the Rennes 1 University, Corentin Choisy, Emma Guilloret and Elvire Sarton-Loh√©ac, and the purpose of our campaign is to promote the awareness about opioid consumption in Europe. 

On this website, you can find useful contacts and references, for both patients and/or professionals. You can also find some short playful movies, explaining some of the main concepts behind opioids, and some posters to print and inform your patients about opioids and the association. The *Articles* section is aimed at informing our followers about the latest news, on many different subjects. Lastly, the *Forum* section allows anyone to speak, ask questions, suggest any idea, send support, in a safe place, and with the possibility of getting answers from professionals.
