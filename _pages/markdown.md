## Opioids: A Global Crisis

The world is currently in the midst of a global opioid addiction and overdose crisis.
Starting during the 90s in South America, this epidemic has gradually spread worldwide.
We can talk about an overarching public health issue.
While opioids are mostly used as prescription drugs, this strictly regulated consumption tends to drift towards more problematic uses.
But what are really opioids ? 
Opioids are naturally found as well in the brain as in the opium plant. 
There are many different associated derived drugs which are used in various therapeutic ways, but are also linked to several adverse effects. 
They are “recognized as necessary and legitimate agents to treat pain”, nevertheless public health risks are rising due to this massive consumption. 
For instance, in the US, the Daily Defined Dose of opioid (DDD) is more than 51 one per million per day. Up to 70% of post prescription doses go unused and proceed to feed an illegal market from where three fifths of the misuse of opioids originates.
